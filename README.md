Duplicates PHP
==============

A script written in PHP that searches for duplicate files in a given folder.

To use this I recomend first install php5, fpcalc and mediainfo.
Then place the dups.php file in the ~/bin/ or /bin folder


it also has the feature to analyze audio files with fpcalc and mediainfo (this feature is a bit slower)

Future features:

 - Be able to save the work on a database.

 - Compare Pictures
